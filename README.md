#JKI JSON Serialization

JKI JSON Serialization is a library for flattening LabVIEW data to JSON strings and for unflattening JSON strings back to LabVIEW data.
This library extends LabVIEW’s native JSON serialization with powerful features such as ability to unflatten JSON strings directly 
to LabVIEW variants, a feature that is useful when building reusable software components. Furthermore our JSON serialization 
library allows unflattening the same JSON string into different LabVIEW data structures allowing for example unflattening 
of a fixed length JSON array into a LabVIEW cluster.

## Installation

You can download and install JKI JSON Serialization with VI Package Manager.
